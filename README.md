# MoviesApp ðŸŽ¬

MoviesApp is an Android project designed to practice working with APIs, Retrofit, and MVVM architecture. The app fetches data of popular movies from The Movie Database (TMDb) API in JSON format, converts it into Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs), and displays it in a RecyclerView arranged in grids. Each grid item is a CardView that contains a movie poster, title, and vote average.

## Features
